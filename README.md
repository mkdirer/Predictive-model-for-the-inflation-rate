# Inflation Predictor
The goal of this project was to build a predictive model for inflation rates. Inflation refers to the general increase in prices of goods and services in an economy over time, leading to a decrease in the purchasing power of money. The project involved building three models - a deep learning model, a linear regression model, and an SVM - using data on consumer price index (CPI), which is the most commonly used measure of inflation.

## Algorithm
The project was implemented using Python programming language and several libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow, scikit-learn, and pickle. The models were trained on CPI data from previous months, with data from before January 1999 excluded due to changes in data classification.
